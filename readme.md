## About

See **Word of the Day** every day on a New Tab.
The assumption is that you will surely learn a new word once you see it throughout the day.

My main motivation is to expand my own vocabulary.
So please don't expect any other out-of-the-box features.
But I am happy to implement any essential Quality of Life features.
If and when I got some free time to do them (planning to work on some other noteworthy projects üòéü§û).

## How to install

1. Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/rational-kunal/Word-Of-The-Day.git
```

2. Change the directory to the cloned repository.

```
cd Word-Of-The-Day
```

3. Install dependencies.

```
npm ci
```

4. Build source code. This should create a `dist` folder.

```
npm run build
```

5. Go to `chrome://extensions` on the chrome browser.
6. Make sure `Developer mode` is checked.
7. Click on `Load unpacked Extensions`.
8. Select the `dist` folder.
9. Open a new tab and check that the Word of the Day appears.

## How it works

- Word of the Day is fetched (i.e. web scraped) from [merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day](https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day).
- To minimize repetitive web scraping, the Extension will **store recent Word of the Day in local storage**.
- To ensure that web scraping still works correctly, tests on the parsing logic are scheduled to run every other day.
